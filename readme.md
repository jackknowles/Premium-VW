This is a project made for an interview

The idea is to make a product page for a car dealership inspired by VW

The focus is on the VW e-Golf

I decided to make this with HTML, CSS and JS alone.
- Right now I am working on using SASS but have better strengths in the technologies above
- No bootstrap was used for the same reason.
- This has not be SEO optimised, as it wasn't the vrief.
- Nor does it have things like favicons.

Important notes:
There's a few things unfinished currently.

a. to make the background around the form clickable and removable
b. to make the one image into an image gallery with next and previous arrows
    possibly with scrolling function, for mobile users

Project planned and developed entirely by Jack Knowles - for more info feel free to contact JKnowles.webdev@gmail.com
